## if you are a speaker
[make a pull request](https://github.com/beaumontjs/beaumontjs.github.io/compare) with your slide deck for the meetup. The talks are stored under `/CURRENT_YEAR/CURRENT_MONTH/TALK_NAME`.

The `/template` directory provides a sample HTML/CSS/JS slide deck library that I (@joahg) wrote for my talks, which you are welcome to use for yours.
